;;; Code:

;; If emacs is run in a terminal, the clipboard- functions have no
;; effect. Instead, we use of xsel, see
;; http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/ -- "a command-line
;; program for getting and setting the contents of the X selection"
(unless window-system
  (when (getenv "DISPLAY")
    ;; Callback for when user cuts
    (defun xsel-cut-function (text &optional push)
      ;; Insert text to temp-buffer, and "send" content to xsel stdin
      (with-temp-buffer
        (insert text)
        ;; I prefer using the "clipboard" selection (the one the
        ;; typically is used by c-c/c-v) before the primary selection
        ;; (that uses mouse-select/middle-button-click)
        (call-process-region (point-min) (point-max) "xsel" nil 0 nil "--clipboard" "--input")))
    ;; Call back for when user pastes
    (defun xsel-paste-function()
      ;; Find out what is current selection by xsel. If it is different
      ;; from the top of the kill-ring (car kill-ring), then return
      ;; it. Else, nil is returned, so whatever is in the top of the
      ;; kill-ring will be used.
      (let ((xsel-output (shell-command-to-string "xsel --clipboard --output")))
        (unless (string= (car kill-ring) xsel-output)
          xsel-output )))
    ;; Attach callbacks to hooks
    (setq interprogram-cut-function 'xsel-cut-function)
    (setq interprogram-paste-function 'xsel-paste-function)
